# Road_Accident_repository

Here we are trying to  analyze the Road Safety and Traffic Demographics dataset (UK), containing accidents reported by the police between the years of 2004 - 2017.

# PROJECT GOALS:

Identify factors responsible for most of the reported accidents.
Build a dashboard that is capable of describing the severity of an accident.
Provide recommendations to the Department of Transport (UK Government), to improve road safety policies and prevent recurrences of severe accidents where possible.

# CONTEXt
The UK government amassed traffic data from 2004 to 2017, recording over 2 million accidents in the process and making this one of the most comprehensive traffic data sets out there. It's a huge picture of a country undergoing change.

Decrease emergency response times during afternoon rush-hours (15-19) especially on Fridays.
Allocate resources to investigate high density traffic points and identify new infrastructure needs to divert traffic from dual-carriage ways.
Explore conditions of vehicles and casualties such as vehicle type, age of vehicles registered, pedestrian movements, etc. for policy makers.
Adopt comprehensive distracted driving laws that increase penalties for drivers who commit traffic violations like aggressive overtaking

World Health Organization (WHO) reported that more than 1.25 million people die each year while 50 million are injured as a result of road accidents worldwide. Road accidents are the 10th leading cause of death globally. On current trends, road traffic accidents are to become the 7th leading cause of death by 2030 making it a major public health concern. Between the years 2005 and 2016, there were roughly 2 million road accidents reported in the United Kingdom (UK) alone of which 16,000 were fatal.

As a big data project, I wanted to explore the traffic demographics data in greater detail using machine learning!
